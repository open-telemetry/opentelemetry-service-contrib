# Sample Context

The Sample Context is a Context implementation for [pdata Profiles Sample](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/pdata/pprofile/generated_sample.go), the collector's internal representation for OTLP profile sample data.  This Context should be used when interacted with OTLP profiles.

## Paths
In general, the Sample Context supports accessing pdata using the field names from the [profiles proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/profiles/v1development/profiles.proto).  All integers are returned and set via `int64`.  All doubles are returned and set via `float64`.

The following paths are supported.

| path                                   | field accessed                                                                                                                                     | type                                                                    |
